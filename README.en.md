:video_game: Game inspired by the classic [Choplifter III](https://g.co/kgs/VB3G5z), where the objective is to rescue prisoners of war while surviving enemy attacks. This is the result of the Computer Graphics project, in the eighth semester of Computer Engineering at [Inatel](http://www.inatel.br/home/).
